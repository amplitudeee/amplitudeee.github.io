Here’s a **40-question beginner JavaScript test** in the exact format you requested. It alternates between True/False and Multiple Choice, with explanations grounded in MDN concepts. No asterisks are used, and answer labels match question numbers.

---

Q1: JavaScript is a compiled language. | True | False  
A1: False | Explanation: JavaScript is interpreted, though modern engines use Just-In-Time compilation.

Q2: Which method converts a JSON string into a JavaScript object? | JSON.stringify | JSON.parse | Object.create | String.split  
A2: JSON.parse | Explanation: JSON.parse reads a JSON string and returns a JavaScript object.

Q3: The `let` keyword allows redeclaration of the same variable in the same scope. | True | False  
A3: False | Explanation: `let` does not allow redeclaration in the same scope, unlike `var`.

Q4: Which operator checks both value and type equality? | == | === | = | !=  
A4: === | Explanation: The strict equality operator `===` compares both value and type.

Q5: Functions in JavaScript are first-class objects. | True | False  
A5: True | Explanation: Functions can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned.

Q6: Which method adds one or more elements to the end of an array? | push | pop | shift | unshift  
A6: push | Explanation: `push` appends elements to the end of an array.

Q7: The `const` keyword prevents reassignment of the variable binding. | True | False  
A7: True | Explanation: `const` creates a constant binding, though object contents can still be mutated.

Q8: Which statement stops execution of a loop and continues with the next iteration? | break | continue | return | exit  
A8: continue | Explanation: `continue` skips to the next iteration without exiting the loop.

Q9: JavaScript is single-threaded by design. | True | False  
A9: True | Explanation: JavaScript runs in a single-threaded event loop model.

Q10: Which method returns a new array with elements that pass a test function? | map | filter | reduce | forEach  
A10: filter | Explanation: `filter` creates a new array with elements that satisfy the condition.

Q11: The `typeof null` returns "null". | True | False  
A11: False | Explanation: `typeof null` returns "object" due to a legacy bug.

Q12: Which keyword declares a block-scoped variable? | var | let | const | all of the above  
A12: let | Explanation: `let` declares block-scoped variables, unlike `var`.

Q13: Arrow functions bind their own `this`. | True | False  
A13: False | Explanation: Arrow functions do not bind `this`; they inherit it lexically.

Q14: Which method executes a function once for each array element? | map | forEach | reduce | every  
A14: forEach | Explanation: `forEach` runs a callback for each element without returning a new array.

Q15: JavaScript can manipulate the DOM directly. | True | False  
A15: True | Explanation: JavaScript interacts with the DOM via APIs like `document.querySelector`.

Q16: Which operator is used to assign default values in destructuring? | = | ? | || | ??  
A16: = | Explanation: Default values in destructuring use the `=` operator.

Q17: The `NaN` value is equal to itself. | True | False  
A17: False | Explanation: `NaN === NaN` is false; use `Number.isNaN()` to check.

Q18: Which method combines two arrays into one? | concat | join | splice | slice  
A18: concat | Explanation: `concat` merges arrays into a new array.

Q19: JavaScript supports prototypal inheritance. | True | False  
A19: True | Explanation: Objects inherit directly from other objects via prototypes.

Q20: Which statement defines a block of code to handle errors? | try | catch | finally | throw  
A20: try | Explanation: `try` encloses code that may throw errors.

Q21: The `undefined` type is the same as `null`. | True | False  
A21: False | Explanation: `undefined` means uninitialized; `null` is an intentional empty value.

Q22: Which method returns the index of the first occurrence of a value in an array? | find | indexOf | includes | search  
A22: indexOf | Explanation: `indexOf` returns the position of the first match.

Q23: Template literals allow embedded expressions using `${}`. | True | False  
A23: True | Explanation: Template literals support interpolation with `${expression}`.

Q24: Which loop is guaranteed to run at least once? | for | while | do...while | for...in  
A24: do...while | Explanation: `do...while` executes before checking the condition.

Q25: JavaScript variables are dynamically typed. | True | False  
A25: True | Explanation: Types are determined at runtime, not at declaration.

Q26: Which method returns a string representation of an array? | toString | join | stringify | slice  
A26: toString | Explanation: `toString` converts array elements into a comma-separated string.

Q27: The `this` keyword always refers to the global object. | True | False  
A27: False | Explanation: `this` depends on context: global, object, or function invocation.

Q28: Which operator spreads elements of an array or object? | ... | * | & | =>  
A28: ... | Explanation: The spread operator expands iterable elements.

Q29: JavaScript supports asynchronous programming with promises. | True | False  
A29: True | Explanation: Promises represent eventual completion or failure of async operations.

Q30: Which method returns a new array with results of applying a function to each element? | map | filter | reduce | forEach  
A30: map | Explanation: `map` transforms each element and returns a new array.

Q31: The `==` operator performs type coercion. | True | False  
A31: True | Explanation: `==` converts operands to the same type before comparison.

Q32: Which keyword is used to create a class in JavaScript? | object | class | function | prototype  
A32: class | Explanation: ES6 introduced the `class` keyword for syntactic sugar over prototypes.

Q33: JavaScript can run outside the browser. | True | False  
A33: True | Explanation: Environments like Node.js allow JavaScript execution outside browsers.

Q34: Which method removes the last element from an array? | pop | shift | splice | slice  
A34: pop | Explanation: `pop` removes and returns the last element.

Q35: The `async` keyword makes a function return a promise. | True | False  
A35: True | Explanation: `async` functions always return promises.

Q36: Which operator is used for exponentiation in JavaScript? | ^ | ** | pow | exp  
A36: ** | Explanation: The `**` operator performs exponentiation.

Q37: JavaScript is case-sensitive.  | True | False
A37: True | Explanation: Variable and function names are case-sensitive.

Q38: Which method converts a JavaScript object into a JSON string? | JSON.parse | JSON.stringify | Object.toString | Stringify  
A38: JSON.stringify | Explanation: `JSON.stringify` serializes objects to JSON format.

Q39: The `void` operator evaluates an expression and returns `undefined`. | True | False
A39: True | Explanation: `void` discards the return value of an expression.

Q40: Which method adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array? | unshift | push | shift | pop
A40: unshift | Explanation: `unshift` prepends elements to the start of an array.
